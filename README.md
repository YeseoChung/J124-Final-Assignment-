# J124 Final Project

Datasets I worked with are: 
* "Student Data" which deals with data related to vaccinations and exemptions for incoming kindergarteners from school years 2000-2001 through 2014-2015. 
* "pertussisRates_2010_2015" which outlines pertussis rates by county between 2010 and 2015. 

**Which county had the highest number of PBE(Personal belief exemption)?**
1. Create pivot table with "County" as row and "Sum of nPBE" as value.
2. Copy entire pivot table and paste into new sheet as "values only."
3. Sort "nPBE" column from "Z to A" to find the highest number of personal belief exemptions. <br/>
_Los Angeles County had the highest number of PBE(Personal belief exemptions) with 24,015._

**What percent of each county had PBE in 2014?**



**Which county had the highest number of MMR vaccinations?**
1. Create pivot table with "County" as row and "nMMR" as value. 
2. Copy entire pivot table and paste into new sheet as "values only."
3. Sort "nPBE" column from "Z to A" to find the highest number of personal belief exemptions. 


**Using "pertussisRates_2010_2015" identify which year had the highest number of pertussis cases.**
1. The dataset had a total count and rate of pertussis for the entire state of california. 
2. Between 2010 and 2014, the year with the highest number of pertussis in California was in 2014.
